🚀 Key Projects
1. Accident Detection and Emergency Alert System (2023–24)
Real-time crash detection using MPU6050 IMU with threshold-based monitoring.

Integrated Neo-6M GPS for geolocation and SIM800L GSM for automated alerts to emergency responders.

Embedded actuators for driver alerts (buzzer/LED), optimized for vehicular environments.

2. Analog Circuit Layout and Simulation (2024–25)
Designed and verified analog IP blocks like Two-Stage CMOS Op-Amps, Differential Amplifiers, and Comparators in Cadence Virtuoso (180nm CMOS).

Conducted pre-layout & post-layout simulations for PSRR, gain, bandwidth, and phase margin.

Applied Monte Carlo & Corner Analysis for process-voltage-temperature (PVT) robustness.

3. Sonic Vision: Wearable Tool for Blind People (2024–25)
Built a Raspberry Pi 5–based prototype integrating YOLOv5 + MediaPipe for object detection.

Added EasyOCR for text reading and ultrasonic sensors for spatial awareness.

Developed GPIO-controlled haptic feedback and an LLM-based voice interface for seamless user interaction.
